                <p>
                    Lab 1 was developing this webiste! First I created a wireframe of the website using a design tool named Canva. 
                    From there, I established a public website using GitHub as the host provider. 
                    Once set up, I created the website using HTML and CSS- making sure to follow all requirements.

                <h2>
                    Lab 2- Part 1
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Lab 2 Part 1, we were told to create a modified calculator using jQuery. 
                    I enhanced the initial application by adding user inputs for the two numerical values. 
                    From there, I added a drop down menu for calculation operations including: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 
                    Finally, I added a drop down menu for color customization including: Red, Blue, and Green.

                <p>
                    For Lab 2 Part 2, we were asked to create a picture slideshow using jQuery. 
                    I added four images from Unsplash which are copyright free and comply with Creative Commons licensing requirements. 
                    I also added a 'Next' button to slide each image per click with a fade transition. 
                    Some enhancements I have added are image counter.

                <p> 
                    For Lab 3 Part 3, we were asked to take JSON content and use jQuery/Javascript to access values inside it. The extracted values such as title, publishers, contributions, publish date, and page number can be found in this lab.

                <p> 
                    For part 4 in Lab 3, we are asked to use the same concept as part 3, but with weather data. The extracted values such as city name, temperature, min/max temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind can be found in this lab.
